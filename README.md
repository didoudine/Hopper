What even is this?
------------------
The [Debug Bar][] plugin has been an invaluable tool for working with WordPress
code, however it's far from perfect. While it incorporates a heap of useful
data, there's a lot more that it misses. It also doesn't provide many useful
APIs for development.

Hopper is an effort to improve this. Based on Symfony's Web Profiler, the idea
is to use WordPress' internals against itself and provide the best dang profiler
and debugger around.

What's with the name?
---------------------
Hopper is named for the legendary [Grace Hopper][] who was a pioneer in the
field of computing, inventing the first compiler and first machine-independent
programming language (COBOL). She's also credited with popularising the term
"debugging", based on her experience with fixing a computer problem by removing
a moth from the system.

A [hopper][] is also a container used to collect and disperse material, which is
a fitting name for a plugin that collects data and compiles it for developers.
